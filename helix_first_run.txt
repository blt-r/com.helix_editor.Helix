You are running flatpak version of Helix.
You can open issues related to this flatpak at https://github.com/flathub/@FLATPAK_ID@/issues

This version is running inside a container and is therefore not able
to access tools on your host system!

To execute commands on the host system, you can use:

  $ flatpak-spawn --host <COMMAND>

If you want to use language server installed on your host system,
you will have to add an entry into your languages.toml file.
For example:

  [[language]]
  name = "rust"
  language-server = { command = "flatpak-spawn", args = ["--host", "rust-analyzer"] }
 


Alternatively, you can install flatpak SDK extensions to get support for languages.

By default you have access to standard development environment (gcc, python, etc.)
provided by org.freedesktop.Sdk.

To get support for additional languages (including language servers),
you have to install SDK extensions, e.g.

  $ flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.rust-stable
  $ flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.llvm15

To see what's available:

  $ flatpak run --command=sh @FLATPAK_ID@
  $ ls /usr/bin # Binaries in shared runtime
  $ ls /usr/lib/sdk # Installed SDK extensions
  $ ls /usr/lib/sdk/<EXTENSION> # Things provided by the extension

After installing you will need to enable selected extensions,
for that set FLATPAK_ENABLE_SDK_EXT environment variable to a comma-separated
list of extension names (name is ID portion after the last dot).
Also, to use all installed extensions, you can set it to "*", but that will cause troubles
if you have multiple versions of the same SDK extension installed 

  $ FLATPAK_ENABLE_SDK_EXT=rust-stable,llvm15 flatpak run @FLATPAK_ID@

This will add to $PATH things like compilers, language servers, and other tools.



After that, you can run Helix with --health option to see which language servers have been detected.

  $ FLATPAK_ENABLE_SDK_EXT=rust-stable,llvm15 flatpak run @FLATPAK_ID@ --health

Or get information about specific language:

  $ FLATPAK_ENABLE_SDK_EXT=rust-stable,llvm15 flatpak run @FLATPAK_ID@ --health rust


To make this persistent, set the variable via flatpak override:

  $ flatpak override --user @FLATPAK_ID@ --env=FLATPAK_ENABLE_SDK_EXT="rust-stable,llvm15"


To find other SDK extensions you can use:

  $ flatpak search <TEXT>
